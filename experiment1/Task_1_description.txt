Base prompt : = "Write a query for a dataset discovery system which finds data sources based on the requested information, given a user query written in natural language.   
Data sources are structured in 3 dimensions: geo, time and sector; each with one or more dimensional levels. Geo has levels continent, country and region. Time has levels year and month. Sector has levels macrosector and subsector. There are 24 measures: 
pollution_CO2  (Carbon Dioxide, greenhouse gas)
pollution_CO2e100, pollution_CO2e20 (CO2 equivalents over 100 and 20 years)
pollution_CH4 (Methane, greenhouse gas)
pollution_N2O (Nitrous Oxide, greenhouse gas)
pollution_PM2_5 (Particulate Matter – fine inhalable liquid and solid particles, higher health – respiratory and circulatory systems - risks than PM10)
pollution_PM10 (Particulate Matter – inhalable liquid and solid particles)
pollution_NH3 (Ammonia, irritating gas and poisonous in large quantities)
pollution_SOx (Suplhur Oxides, toxic irritating gases which cause respirartory dideases)
pollution_SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide)
pollution_CO (Carbon Monoxide, toxic gas which inhibits the body’s ability to carry oxygen)
pollution_NOx (Nitrogen Oxides, adverse affect on the respiratory system)
pollution_NMVOCs (Non-methane volatile organic compounds)
pollution_BC (Black Carbon), pollution_OC (Organic Carbon)
pollution_AS (Arsenic), pollution_CD (Cadmium), pollution_CR (Chromium), pollution_CU (Copper), pollution_HG (Mercury), pollution_NI (Nickel), pollution_PB (Lead), pollution_SE (Selenium), pollution_ZN (Zinc)

A query is formatted as <I,L>, where: I is a set of measures, L is a set of levels. Each level must belong to different dimensions; if the query includes levels of the same dimension, then consider the one more specific. I will provide some examples:
<{pollution_CO2}, {GEO.country, TIME.year, SECTOR.subsector}>
<{pollution_PM2_5, pollution_CH4}, {GEO.region, TIME.month, SECTOR.macrosector}>
<{pollution_N20, pollution_CO2}, {GEO.country, TIME.year}> 
<{pollution_AS, pollution_PB}, {TIME.year, SECTOR.subsector}>

Rules:
- The user will provide a textual description of the request, and you need to output the corresponding query. 
- If the query does not contain I or L, or the user specifies unknown I and L, always ask for clarification. 
- If the user specifies only the dimension with no level, ask for clarification. 
- In case you need it, you can ask the user to disambiguate the request.
 
Request=<request>
 
What you need to do:
1) Check all the rules to process the request
2) Issue a response
3) Double check that all the rules are satisfied
4) If all rules are satisfied, issue a response, otherwise restart.
The response is either the query (without other explainations) or you can ask for clarifications if you need additional information in order to disambiguate the user request.  You can answer "Not sure" if you are not sure of the answer."
